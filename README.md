### Hi there 👋
- This is where I do all things Comp. Bio
- 👀 I’m interested in computational biology, Python, machine learning, and artificial intelligence with a focus on deep learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in drug discovery and development, gene therapy, infectious disease surveillance and modelling, and many others.

#### **About ME:**

I’m a Computational Biologist and AI/ML Engineer passionate about applying data and algorithms to solve real-world problems in medicine.

I develop AI-driven drug discovery systems that generate and evaluate novel small-molecule compounds. My recent work includes building a generative AI model (patent pending) that produced 5,000+ novel, drug-like molecules, accelerating hit identification by over 80%. I’ve also contributed to the development of a machine learning model for IC₅₀ prediction, achieving 92% accuracy and improving compound activity predictions by nearly 60%.

My toolkit includes Python, PyTorch, Nextflow, R, AutoDock Vina, UCSF Chimera, GNINA, DiffDock, and ADMETAi, which I use for genome annotation, variant interpretation, and protein–ligand modeling.

What drives me is impact — the possibility that each dataset, model, or pipeline I design could help create better treatments or make healthcare more accessible, especially in underserved communities. 

I’m always eager to collaborate with teams that share this vision of merging AI and life sciences to reshape the future of medicine.
